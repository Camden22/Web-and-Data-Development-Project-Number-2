            <p>
                The first time I saw this movie I absolutely loved it, the soundtrack, the visuals, the story, and especially the aimation, everything was awesome.

                <br>
                <br>

                I loved the prequel of this movie, and I think movie is good respectively, but Across the Spider-Verse is currently the favorite.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Miles Morales</h2>

                        <p>
                            His character in the movie is really well done, just like the first Spider-Verse movie, Miles has a great story arc throughput the film and his design is even cooler.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            He recieved a new suit that consists of bigger eyes, a more complex design, and new texturing to the fabric.

                    <li>
                        <h2>Spider-Man 2099</h2>

                        <p>
                            AKA: Miguel O' Hara
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This character has the perfect ominous character development, and super cool designs. His suit is made of cybernetic material, as opposed to traditional fabirc,
                            and he can rift through the multiverse with the dial of a watch. (Can be seen entering another universe through a portal in the image below).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            He has never been seen before in a feature film, so this is an amazing first impression.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Spider-Punk</h2>

                        <p>
                            AKA: Hobie Brown
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Spider-Punk has has one of the most unique designs I've seen in a spider-man, as parts of his body are filled in with actual news paper clippings to give him the desired look.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This is also Spider-Punk's first feature film impression, so it is yet another great introduction.

                This 7 season animated series is an ammzing addition to the Star Wars movies.

                <br>
                <br>
                
                It tells the stories of some of my favorite charactes in the franchise,
                and does an amazing job in filling in the empty space in the timeline between Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.

                    This is a list of some of my favorite characters from the show, expertly crafted.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Captain Rex</h2>

                        <p>
                            He shows a true character throuhout the show and is a made to be one of the most likable clones on the show, as his loyalty was unchanging throughout all 7 seasons.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            His armor had slightly changed throughout the show, but his character welded parts of his old armor with his new armor to keep his same style, how cool is that?
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Anakin</h2>

                        <p>
                            Despite eventually being known as Darth Vader
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Anakin as the Jedi before becoming a sith lord in Revenge of the Sith is depicted to be incredibly skilled in combat during the Clone Wars. The writers did a great job slowly developing his character throughout the show based upon what we eventually know him to be in the later movies.
