    <p>
        Either it be traditional, digital, for school, for me, for no one but my own improvement, I love making art.

        <br>
        <br>
        
        It has always been apart of my life and it's something that I've found I can do most places (notebook permitted).

    <h2>Here is a collage of some of my favorite pieces, Enjoy!</h2>
