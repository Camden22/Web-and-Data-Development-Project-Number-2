            Last summer, my family went here for two weeks and it quickly became one of my favorite summer vacations.
        <br>
        <br>
            So, I'd love to share some information about the destination so maybe you can get a glimpse into your own experiences here.

                    Since Newport Beach in on the edge of an penninsula, the beach was always in view, and was often very accessible from the boardwalk by the pier.
                    
                <br>
                <br>

                    We would walk on the sand, sit under an umbrella, throw what ever ball we could find, or play <em>KanJam</em>.
                    
                    I'm also not used to the water temperature of the Pacific, so it was always a challenge to get into the water, but when the waves called, there wasn't another option. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                    
                    There was also this really cool surfing place called The Wedge. It was all the way at the end of the penninsula, and had some of the biggest waves and bravest people I've seen.
                    I tried surfing, but it was on waves that had little to no comparison to the waves at The Wedge. If you were going to surf there, you were either really really good, or you probably lost a bet.

                <br>
                <br>
                    
                    To the right is a picture of a hat I bought in California in honor of surfers who dared to conquer The Wedge, but mostly I bought it because I needed a hat, and I like blue.

                <br>
                    The food in Newport is really good, after only staying there for two weeks, the resturants become inconic to us as we would pass them by during the day.
                    The Mexican resturants were my favorite because the burritos were amazing. They would also let you get breakfast burittos in the evening, so if your a fan
                    of breakfast food for dinner, you should go to <em>Baja Sharkeez</em>.
                <br>
                <br>
                    If we didn't know where to eat, <em>Baja Sharkeez</em>, if we didn't have dinner plans that night, <em>Baja Sharkeez</em>, if we knew where to eat and it wasn't <em>Baja Sharkeez</em>,
                    then we didn't eat at <em>Baja Sharkeez</em>, but, we considered it.
                <br>
                <br>
                    
                    There was also a resturant called <em>Sanchos Tacos</em>. Any time I've had a taco or a burrito since, my first comparison is with <em>Sanchos Tacos</em>. 10/10 food,
                    and they don't oversalt the chips they give you which is nice as a personal preference (adding salt is much easier than trying to remove it).

                    <br>
                        Since everything was so close to each other, we would usually walk everywhere and rarely drove. We also rented bikes to use too, as they made navigating the boardwalk much esaie.
                        One of our favorite things to do is walking all the way down the jetty by the Wedge, which is basically a long line of massive rocks that goes out into the water. Always a bit challenging, but a lot of fun.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                       If we weren't out riding bikes or walking on rocks, we were hanging out on the beach, either boogie boarding, listening to music under an umbrella, or throwing around a frisbee with the occasional game of <em>KanJam</em> or basketball at a nearby park.
                    <br>

                        To the right is a photo of my brother and I discussing important business matters. You can tell just how important our discussion is by the fact that I am wearing Nike Slides and definely not trying to laugh.
                        But, acknowledge that what you see is an attempt to throw off anyone that might suspect such important business matters are being discussed, as it is actually what's taking place in the discussion at hand.
